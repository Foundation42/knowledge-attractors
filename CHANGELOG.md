- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suites
- **Package & Deploy**: Distribution and CI/CD setup
- **Documentation**: Complete guides and references
- **Archive**: Historical research and experiments

### 🔬 **Research Foundation**

Built on breakthrough research in knowledge attractors:
- "Unavoidable but Silent" mechanism for pattern integration
- Resonance-based mining from actual codebases
- Compact serialization techniques
- ASA bias for lightweight token steering
- Adaptive pressure systems for improved integration

### 📋 **Archive**

Preserved original research in `archive/` directory:
- **Research Documents**: Original breakthrough papers and analysis
- **Experimental Code**: Early prototypes and proof-of-concepts
- **Results Data**: Research findings and experimental validation
- **Documentation**: Historical context and development journey

### ⚠️ **Breaking Changes**

This release represents a complete rewrite focused on code generation:
- Original general-purpose attractor system moved to archive
- CLI interface completely redesigned for code use cases
- Configuration format updated for coding model optimization
- Package name changed to reflect code-specific focus

### 🚀 **Migration Guide**

For users of the research system:
1. Original research code preserved in `archive/` directory
2. New CLI: `python -m attractor_kit` instead of `mad_cli.py`
3. Code-specific configuration in `code_attractor_config.json`
4. Enhanced tag injection replaces original system

### 🎯 **The Vision Realized**

This release transforms the original knowledge attractor research into a production system that makes every codebase's DNA available to any coding model, creating repo-aware AI assistants that write code like senior team members.
