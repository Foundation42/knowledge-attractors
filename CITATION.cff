  Masked Attractor Discovery learns the gaps between known points in embedding space.
  We train a teacher embedding on full text, mask a concept set, and teach a small
  student to reconstruct the missing vectors from context. Probes then snap into
  high-density "gap" regions—i.e., implied concepts. On toy and domain corpora we
  achieve 88–93% Top-1 masked recovery (100% Top-5, mean cosine ≥ 0.92), surface
  stable attractors (84% persistence), and drive two applications: a Creativity Add-On
  that emits grounded idea cards, and RLAD, a curiosity loop where the model chooses
  what to learn next by geometric information gain.
