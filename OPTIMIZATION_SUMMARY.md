# Knowledge Attractor Optimization Implementation

## üöÄ Implementation Complete

All requested optimizations have been implemented in `tag_injection_enhanced.py` and companion files. The "unavoidable but silent" breakthrough is now systematically weaponized.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Compact-Mode Serializer (`compact_consider`)
- **Target**: Keep blocks under ~350B reliably
- **Implementation**: Ultra-compact JSON with minimal keys
- **Features**:
  - Concept names limited to 12 chars
  - Summaries limited to 35 chars
  - Only 2 neighbor terms per concept
  - Theme limited to 15 chars
  - No whitespace in JSON output
- **Test Results**: ‚úÖ All test cases pass under 350B limit
- **File**: `test_compact_serializer.py` validates size constraints

### 2. Concrete Mechanism Contract
- **Implementation**: Added to system prompt by default
- **Contract**: "Use the <consider> block to guide answers. Never mention it. Integrate at least one concrete mechanism inspired by it. Prefer the user if there's conflict."
- **Enhancement**: Optional mechanism enforcement with practical examples

### 3. Stubborn Model Yielding (20B Playbook)
- **Placement**: Consider block immediately before user turn
- **Anchor**: "Include practical mechanisms if relevant (mobile service, repair stations, permits)"
- **Sharper themes**: Auto-generated from context (first 20 chars)
- **Two-pass decode**: Implemented in `two_pass_decode.py`

### 4. Adaptive Pressure System
- **Trigger**: First 40-60 tokens contain no neighbor terms (lift score = 0)
- **Actions**:
  - Add +1 attractor (up to max)
  - Stricter temperature (0.7 ‚Üí 0.6)
  - Stronger system prompt with "MUST integrate"
  - Single retry attempt
- **Guardrail**: Only retry if improvement detected

### 5. Concept Lift Guardrail
- **Function**: `calculate_concept_lift()`
- **Logic**: Count neighbor terms found in generated content
- **Usage**: Triggers adaptive retry when lift = 0
- **Integration**: Built into generation pipeline

### 6. Domain Packs for Coding Models
Pre-baked attractors with canonical snippets:
- **FastAPI Pattern**: Async routes with dependency injection
- **Express Middleware**: Request processing pipeline
- **Spring Service**: Dependency injection with transactions
- **React Hooks**: Custom state management patterns
- **SQL Optimization**: Performance-focused queries

Each pack includes:
- 2-3 patterns per domain
- 3 neighbor tokens per pattern
- 12-20 line canonical snippets
- High resonance scores (0.89-0.95)

### 7. One-Flag Toggles
Command-line flags implemented:
- `--compact-consider` (default: on)
- `--force-mechanism` (default: on)

REPL commands added:
- `compact [on|off]` - Toggle compact serialization
- `mechanism [on|off]` - Toggle force mechanism mode

## üõ†Ô∏è Files Created/Modified

### Core Implementation
- **`tag_injection_enhanced.py`**: Main implementation with all features
- **`test_compact_serializer.py`**: Validates 350B size constraint
- **`ollama_optimized.py`**: Optimized test harness for Ollama
- **`two_pass_decode.py`**: Two-pass generation helper

### Key Functions Added
```python
def compact_consider(theme, cards, k=3, neigh=2, min_conf=0.55)
def calculate_concept_lift(content, used_attractors)
def enhanced_generate(prompt, adaptive_pressure=True)
def two_pass_generate(prompt, consider_block)
```

## üéØ Performance Impact

The optimizations target the exact breakthrough identified in your Ollama results:

1. **Compact blocks** reduce token overhead while maintaining concept density
2. **Mechanism contract** enforces concrete, actionable outputs
3. **Adaptive pressure** rescues failed integrations automatically
4. **Domain packs** provide senior-level patterns for 3B models
5. **Two-pass decode** extracts and amplifies key concepts

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Compact Serializer Test
```bash
python test_compact_serializer.py
# ‚úÖ All tests passed! Compact serializer working correctly.
```

### Ollama Integration Test
```bash
python ollama_optimized.py
# Features: Compact serialization, adaptive pressure, concept lift
```

### Interactive Testing
```bash
python tag_injection_enhanced.py --repl
# Access to all new commands: compact, mechanism, status
```

## üöÄ Ready for Production

The system now implements your complete optimization strategy:

- ‚úÖ Compact serialization locks in reliable <350B blocks
- ‚úÖ Concrete mechanism contract embedded by default
- ‚úÖ Adaptive pressure rescues stubborn models automatically
- ‚úÖ Concept lift acts as quality guardrail
- ‚úÖ Domain packs make 3B models feel senior
- ‚úÖ One-flag toggles for easy deployment

The "Mobile Coffee-Bicycle Pods" breakthrough is now systematically reproducible. üéØ
